# pdf_to_doc
a clean, robust implementation that:

Works for text-based and scanned PDFs

Preserves layout as much as possible

Avoids licensing traps with free/open-source tools

Handles batch conversions

1. Key Considerations

Text-based PDFs → Easy, you can extract text and formatting directly.

Image/scanned PDFs → Requires OCR (e.g., Tesseract) to recognize text.

DOC vs DOCX → DOC is an old binary format; DOCX (Office Open XML) is easier to generate.

Preserving formatting → The better the PDF quality, the more faithful the conversion.

2. Technology Stack

pdf2docx → Direct PDF → DOCX conversion for text-based files.

PyMuPDF (fitz) → Extract text/images if finer control needed.

pytesseract + Pillow → OCR for scanned PDFs.

python-docx → Generate DOCX from extracted content manually if needed.
