# pdf_to_doc
a clean, robust implementation that:

Works for text-based and scanned PDFs

Preserves layout as much as possible

Avoids licensing traps with free/open-source tools

Handles batch conversions

1. Key Considerations

Text-based PDFs → Easy, you can extract text and formatting directly.

Image/scanned PDFs → Requires OCR (e.g., Tesseract) to recognize text.

DOC vs DOCX → DOC is an old binary format; DOCX (Office Open XML) is easier to generate.

Preserving formatting → The better the PDF quality, the more faithful the conversion.

2. Technology Stack

pdf2docx → Direct PDF → DOCX conversion for text-based files.

PyMuPDF (fitz) → Extract text/images if finer control needed.

pytesseract + Pillow → OCR for scanned PDFs.

python-docx → Generate DOCX from extracted content manually if needed.

about building a locally running AI-powered software project that uses agents (maybe multi-agent coordination, like AutoGen, LangChain Agents, or custom MCP — Model Control Protocol–style) to process PDFs and convert them to DOC/DOCX, possibly with extra intelligence (summarizing, fixing formatting, extracting tables, etc.).

Here’s how I’d approach local AI-powered PDF→DOCX software development in a way that’s secure, offline-capable, and modular.

1. Core Idea

Instead of just blindly converting PDFs, your app could:

Detect whether it’s text-based or scanned.

Extract and reconstruct content intelligently (tables, headers, images, footnotes).

Summarize, reformat, and even translate.

Run completely offline using locally hosted models.

This is where agent-based orchestration comes in — you can have:

File Handler Agent → detects file type, splits into pages.

OCR Agent → uses Tesseract or a local vision model if scanned.

Layout Agent → identifies paragraphs, tables, images.

Writer Agent → uses python-docx to create a well-structured DOCX.

QA Agent → double-checks accuracy.

2. Local AI Stack
Component	Purpose	Local-Friendly Options
LLM	Reasoning, text reformatting, summarization	Ollama with LLaMA 3, Mistral, or CodeLLaMA
Vision/OCR	Reading scanned images	Tesseract, EasyOCR, or PaddleOCR
Agent Framework	Multi-step orchestration	LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, or custom MCP-like event bus
PDF Parsing	Extract text/images	PyMuPDF, pdfplumber
Word Output	Save DOCX	python-docx

4. Example Agent-Oriented Setup (Local)
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.llms import Ollama
import fitz, pytesseract
from docx import Document
from PIL import Image
import io

# Tools
def extract_text_tool(pdf_path: str) -> str:
    pdf = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    text = ""
    for page in pdf:
        text += page.get_text()
    return text

def ocr_tool(pdf_path: str) -> str:
    pdf = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    text = ""
    for page in pdf:
        pix = page.get_pixmap(dpi=300)
        img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(pix.tobytes("png")))
        text += pytesseract.image_to_string(img)
    return text

def write_docx_tool(content: str, output_path: str):
    doc = Document()
    doc.add_paragraph(content)
    doc.save(output_path)
    return output_path

tools = [
    Tool(name="ExtractText", func=extract_text_tool, description="Extract text from PDF"),
    Tool(name="OCRText", func=ocr_tool, description="Extract text from scanned PDF"),
    Tool(name="WriteDocx", func=write_docx_tool, description="Save DOCX")
]

llm = Ollama(model="llama3")  # Runs locally

agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description")

# Run
agent.run("Convert 'sample.pdf' to a DOCX file with formatting preserved")

5. Why MCP-like Architecture Helps

If you design this like MCP (Message Control Protocol):

Each agent is a service/module that communicates over a message bus (local event loop or sockets).

Agents can run in parallel (OCR while layout is analyzed).

Easy to plug in new capabilities (e.g., translation agent).

You could use:

Redis Pub/Sub or ZeroMQ for local agent messaging.

Python asyncio event loop for async execution.

YAML config for pipeline definitions (like Airflow DAGs but for AI tasks).

6. AI-Enhanced Features You Could Add

Table reconstruction using local vision models (detect + recreate in DOCX tables).

Auto-cleaning OCR text (removing artifacts, page numbers).

Semantic layout preservation (headings, bullet points).

Multi-language support (translate before writing DOCX).

Smart splitting for very large PDFs.

If you want, I can design this as a ready-to-run local AI PDF→DOCX Agent Framework with:

MCP-style modular agents

Ollama for reasoning

Tesseract for OCR

python-docx for DOCX output

Configurable pipeline in YAML

That would give you a fully offline, AI-enhanced document converter.

Do you want me to draft that full local AI architecture + code scaffold next? That would give you a development-ready foundation.
